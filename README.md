# Predict the Next Frame by an Improved Pix2Pix Model
This codebase is an improved version of a Pix2Pix implementation from [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix) for predicting the next frame of a video clip. It receives multiple consecutive frames as input and predicts the next frame.
